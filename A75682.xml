            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>GOod Readers and Friends, ſuch you are to me, however I am or may be unto you; what God ſhall cauſe me here to write, as a Preface, or Apology, is not for my ſelf at all, but for you all, that is, all for you: I ſeek not my ſelf herein, (God forbid) and God forbid I ſhould have a thought, or any itching to ſpeak, to make you ſpeak in the behalf of me, who am a poor man, a nothing but ſin, (as I am in my ſelf) therefore not fit to be mentioned, no other than to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as I am in my ſelf, and God to be praiſed and glorified, as I am in him, brought home to him, living in him, and for that I find and know that he liveth in me. I have not, nor I ſhall not (I truſt through Grace) ever henceforth, go aboue to ſpeak or write my ſelf, but him that hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me, and as he ſhall enable me, and ſhew forth himſelf in me, and unto me; for I deſire to forget my ſelf with my whole heart, unleſs
<pb facs="tcp:151112:3"/> to humble me, and to exalt the honour and praiſe of my God, who hath not only created me, but ſaved me, his I am, and his praiſes I will ſpeak. Wherefore all ye that ſhall come to ſee theſe lines, and this following diſcourſe, I truſt that you ſhall ſee the Power of God accompanying them, and owning them for his own words and works, and if you find them not on your own Spirits to be his, diſown them and me; but I dare you ſo to do, whoever you be. Read them I willingly would you did, and, Ah, would to God it were (all your Portions) to read them with a double Portion of his Spirit and Preſence, which I had when I writ them, that he that gave them me, would doubly thus give them unto you, then I am ſure you would never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his loving kindneſs, nor ceaſe to publiſh his praiſes; you would I am ſure be never weary telling others the Love of God to your Souls. O God, that art all purity, brightneſs, love, mercy and goodneſs, compaſſionate, I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech thee, the Souls of all thoſe that thou haſt appointed to work on, by this thy Work; it is, O God, thine not mine, I acknowledge it, I confeſs it, I here proclaim and publiſh it, and do for it deſire to ſpeak loudly thy Eternal and everlaſting Praiſes: fill them all, O God, with thine all, with thy heavenly overflowings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou haſt ſo abundantly and frequently filled, feaſted, ſolaced and ſatisfied my Soul;

                  <p n="61">61. But Ah miſerable man, who art only miſerable, that hath no Portion there, what ever Portion he hath here, yea though he abound in Corn and Wine and Oyl, and all this Worlds good and glory.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. Give me, Ah Lord, give me any Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Heaven, though but to be a door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper; if I may but ſee thy face, and hear thy Voice, I care not, though it be with the loſs of all Portions here, both of riches, honours and pleaſures.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. If thou giveſt me here, O Lord, but food and rayment, how mean ſoever it be, I will be content therewith, and heartily thank thee, and if thou giveſt me none, I will thank thee for the time paſt, and believe I ſhall

                  <p n="64">64. Ah if the want of the World be ſo ſweet when in its want we find no want, how ſweet then, yea how much ſweeter is Heavens fulneſs? where is all fulneſs of all things, and therefore no want at all of any thing.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. Ah how much better is it, and how much greater gain, to loſe this Worlds all, and gain Heaven, then to gain this Worlds all, and loſe our part of Heaven, which is Heavens all, yea all Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="66">66. The Worlds loſs with Heavens gain, I ſhall not account any loſs, but all gain, yea the greateſt gain I can get; but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens loſs, with all this Worlds gain, I ſhall not account any gain, but a great loſs, yea the greateſt that I could, or can ſuſtain.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. He that loſeth Heaven loſeth all, but he that gets only this Worlds all, gets no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, even nothing at all.</p>
                  <p n="68">68. I will and always will account all loſſes gain (to win Chriſt) and all gain loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes if I loſe Chriſt.</p>

                  <p n="73">73. That is my life of Sin, for a death to ſin, to put all ſin to death, and then death, for eternal life with Chriſt, who is my life.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. Thou knoweſt, O Lord alſo that I would willingly dye to live, and live to dye.</p>
                  <p n="75">75. That is to dye to ſin, and live to grace, live in all grace and dye to all ſin, that to me to live may be Chriſt, but to dye gain, yea that my life may be hid with Chriſt in God.</p>

                  <p n="79">79. All the World is nothing, being all periſhable, therefore can be to nothing compared, but to nothing.</p>
                  <p n="80">80. Ah what a pity is it, that any man ſhould be ſo ſickle, as to love ſuch fickle things, as are theſe below, which to day are, and to morrow are not.</p>
                  <p n="81">81. For is any thing leſſer, worſer or lighter than vanity; if any thing be, or can be, or if this Worlds things be any thing, it is it, which is ſo much vanity, and ſo full of vanity, and therefore the more, the leſſer worth, the worſer, and the lighter, be all nothing, but all vanity.</p>
                  <p n="82">82. The more there is of a bad thing, the worſer, and the leſſer too, is the thing, (that is to goodneſs.)</p>
                  <p n="83">83. Well therefore may it be ſaid of the beſt of this Worlds, of this Worlds beſt, as the old Woman ſaid unto her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ariſe, Daughter Vanity, and come to thy daughter Vanity, for thy daughter Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath another daughter of Vanity.</p>

                  <p n="86">86. Vanity is in the getting, Vanity is in the keeping, Vanity is in the ſpending, and there is Vanity for the moſt part, in giving of this Worlds Vanity; So that all in this World, even all this World, is Vanity, yea all Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="87">87. Ah vain fooliſh man that laboureſt ſo hard, that hazardeſt ſo much, for that which at the beſt is ſo vain, being ſo full of Vanity, and, which is worſe, vexation of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="88">88. If then its beſt be ſo bad, what is its worſt? if its all be worth nothing at all, why wilt thou then be ſuch a fool? as to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for that which is not, and to ſpend thy time, thy dear, moſt dear, and moſt precious time, for that which will not, for that which cannot profit thee.</p>
                  <p n="89">89. Let then, Ah let then the morrow care for it ſelf, care thou, O man, Oh careleſs man for thy ſelf, that is, for thy better ſelf, which will make thee ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, or elſe thy careleſsneſs, ever miſerable, miſerable for ever.</p>

Let the World take its own, make ſure what is thine own, (if thou wilt ſo have it) which is Chriſt Jeſus, and all his merits, and ſay truly and boldly, I will have none but Chriſt; I care for none but Chriſt, nor to know nothing but Chriſt and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; be then contented if thou haſt him, and be not contented what ever thou haſt, if thou haſt him not.</p>

If then our peace in believing bring ſo great joy, that it paſſeth all underſtanding; Ah how great ſhall our peace and joy be, when it ſhall be above believing, that is, when we ſhall poſſeſs the God and giver of all peace, who is our reſt and peace, yea our peaceable reſt, and he will augment our underſtanding as much as our peace, and yet our peace ſhall ſurpaſs ours, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers underſtanding.</p>

                  <p n="95">95. If then theſe things below be able to

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:151112:101"/> the Kingdom of Satan were not ſo populous, and that he had not ſo many faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, which are ſo faithleſs to Jeſus Chriſt, and to their own poor ſouls; he would that all would believe and receive Chriſt, that they might be all ſaved, becauſe he knoweth that many are intereſſed in every ſouls Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, both in Heaven and on Earth.</p>
                  <p n="190">190. This ſpirit opens Heavens Gates, and leads the ſoul into the Inner Courts, and carries him up into the Brides Chamber, and feaſts him in his Banquettjng houſe, and fills and ſolaces his heart, not with the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies of <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor with the Milk and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but with thoſe ſweet, rich, delitious and pretious, moſt pretious delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that are in that Heavenly Jeruſalem, the City of the living God, where the ſpirit of all juſt men are made perfect, they are fed continually with that rich diſh of aſſurance, and have the fore-taſts of thoſe Eternal joys, which is that bleſſed reſt prepared for the people of God.</p>

And thus this ſpirit cauſeth thoſe in whom it dwelleth, to rejoyce evermore, and again I ſay to rejoyce, for can any man in whom this Spirit dwelleth, who is the Sanctifier, and the Comforter, and ſent us from Heaven by our bleſſed Saviour; (be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted) can any mourn whilſt the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom

Ah no, ſurely no, for he comes with healing in his wings, he bringeth, Ah he bringeth the glad tydings of peace and ſalvation to all Souls where it cometh to abide, and thus are all the Sons of God led by his Spirit, comforted by his Spirit, raviſht with his Spirit, taught by his Spirit, feaſted by his Spirit, brought home unto him by his Spirit, and made one with him by his Spirit, for we have all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs unto the Father through the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; let this then teach us all that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the work of this Spirit, not to quench its motions, not to afflict or grieve this holy Spirit of Bleſſedneſs but be always ready and willing to receive him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him, for if we delight in him, and to abide with him, he will delight in us, and delight to abide in us, for he will not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoking flax, but whereſoever there is the true ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and unfeigned deſires of grace, he will give grace according to theſe deſires, for he will never leave us comfortleſs, but will come unto us, and where he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his work, he will as aſſuredly finiſh it, he will never leave nor forſake us, if we do not leave nor forſake him, but will make our weak and imperfect grace, ſtrong and perfect glory, for he knoweth
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:151112:102"/> all our deſires, and the thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of our hearts are not hid from him, but are always open and naked before him, and he delighted moſt to feed us, when we are moſt thirſty, and to cloath us moſt richly, when we are naked, and to give us the greateſt treaſure when we are pooreſt, and to viſit us when we are moſt ſick for his abſence, and to comfort us when we are moſt diſconſolated and afflicted, and when we caſt our ſelves down, then doth he delight to raiſe us up to the higheſt, and when we think our ſelves worſt, then doth he eſteem us at the beſt, and after our mourning, cauſeth us to rejoyce, and wipes away all tears from our eyes.</p>
                  <p n="192">192. Thus is this Spirit unto us all things, who bringeth us much more joy, than we are able to ask, than we are able to think, it convinceth our hearts of Sin, of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of Judgment.</p>

This Spirit giveth wiſdome to the ſimple, and teacheth the ignorant know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and cauſeth him to underſtand; ſo as Babes and Sucklings ſhew forth his mighty praiſes, for he revealeth unto them, what he hideth from the wiſe and mighty men of the earth, and maketh appear plain that their wiſdom is but meer fooliſhneſs, their

This Spirit ſheweth us, that thoſe things which we ſee not, and cannot ſee, be unto us, as if they were; and thoſe things which we ſee, are, as if they were not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we value them not, but as Pilgrims and ſtrangers, we ſeek a Country, an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</p>

This Spirit openeth unto our ſence, reaſon, and underſtanding, that which no man can ſhut, and ſhutteth that which no man can open; this Spirit declareth unto us, what the mind and will of God is for our good: and worketh in us a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in all our minds, wills and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be carefully ſtudious, and ſtudiouſly careful, to walk in all well pleaſing before him, it maketh us to preſs forward to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that for which we are alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord; it
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:151112:103"/> worketh in us a fear that increaſeth our love, and ſuch love as caſteth out all fear, it maketh us to do, all that we do (for him) and not for our ſelves, loving him much more for himſelf, than for our own ſelves; and more for his glory than for our own glory; if ſuch long to be with him, it is to do him more, and better ſervice; for here we can know but in part, and do but in part, but there we ſhall know him as he is to be known, and do for him all things, which were fore-ordained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him, before that we were, and that is, to poſſeſs him wholly, and holy as he is, that is, as much as is poſſible for us Creatures.</p>
                  <p n="196">196. This Spirit warmeth our hearts ſo with his divine Love, and maketh us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his divine nature, that daily we grow more and more conformable, and like unto him, and to comprehend, and know, more and more, what is the length, the breadth, the height of the depth of his love, to his Children and Servants, and to be ſuch, as eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of any man to conceive rightly, the things that God hath prepared for thoſe that love him.</p>
                  <p n="197">197. The Spirit cauſeth them, where it dwelleth, to feel what they cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:151112:104"/> nor expreſs; and it ſo filleth their hearts with ſuch joy in believing, that there is no joy like unto it; this is that true bread of life, that feedeth them unto eternal life, this is that true water of life, that cauſeth us never more to thirſt, with fear or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; this is that Rock flowing with hony, that reviveth the fainting Spirits of every true <hi>Jonathan</hi> that taſts it with the mouth of Faith, yea this is that Heavenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, and bread of Angels, and Saints, on which they feed and are ſatisfied in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; theſe are the Royal Robes, which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Bridegroom arrayeth us with, even his own Righteouſneſs, and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: this filleth our lamps, with that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oyl of aſſurance, that we ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto that marriage Feaſt, and Supper of the Lamb; this gives them all to know that their names are written in the Book of life, and that their lives are hid with Chriſt in God. So that when he ſhall appear at his ſecond and ſudden coming, they ſhall alſo appear with him in glory; this cauſeth them to hear his moſt ſweet, and bleſſed voice, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdom prepared for you, before the foundation of the World was laid; this aſſureth them that God is, and will be their Portion for ever; this cauſeth them to know,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:151112:104"/> that they ſhall all ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and that God will not be aſhamed, to be called their God, and to own them for his own, even for his Sons and Daughters in Jeſus Chriſt; this is that new name, which they all know that have it, and this is that which fills them with true love to adore all his Attributes of Juſtice, as well as of mercy; and for that there is a Hell for the wicked, as a Heaven for the righteous; for their greateſt joy, and glory is, for that he is, what he is, and for that he doth what he doth; for all things that pleaſe him pleaſe them, his honour is their honour, and his glory their glory, and therefore they delight to bleſs, and praiſe, and laud, and extol, and magnifie his holy name, and this cauſeth them ſo earneſtly to beſeech, and beg, and pray Souls to come to Chriſt, and to waſh and bath themſelves in this fountain of his blood, which is always open for ſin, and for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs; this maketh them to prize it above all works, knowing that it is the work of the Lord, and that in it he is well pleaſed, and that many are loſers in the loſs of a Soul, and that great is the joy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the converſion of a ſinner; this makes them to feel what they ſpeak, and to ſpeak what they feel; this makes them ſo willing

Ah who is not an Orator fit enough, to ſet forth the uglineſs

Ah who would not rejoyce to do ſuch a work, as to hinder poor Souls from having ſuch a portion as this, and bring them home to Jeſus Chriſt, who is the great Doctor, who will give them this his Holy Spirit to teach them, lead them, direct them, and inſtruct them, in thoſe things which belong to their eternal peace and Salvation, which is in all truth, and holineſs.</p>
                  <p n="198">198. Thus are all thoſe in whom this Spirit of God dwelleth, made partakers of his own holy, and divine nature, to love the brethren, even with this true, ſincere, and free love, that they may for ever and ever

                  <p n="199">199. Thus bleſſed, and for ever bleſſed are all thoſe, that have this bleſſed Spirit of God for their Portion on Earth, which ſhall lead them as the Sons of God, unto God their Father and their Portion in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who is the Portion, the Father and the everlaſting Reſt of all the bleſſed.</p>

Ah holy Father, increaſe this thy love in the hearts of all thy Children and Servants here on earth, that we may together go hand in hand, witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that the love wherewith we love one another is from thy Love, and that we live in thee and thou in us, who art all Love, even the God of Love, and that it is from

Ah Lord God, for thine own great, glorious and holy names ſake, take not this thy Holy Spirit the Comforter from me, but let it ever abide and dwell in me, that I may always go forth before thee rejoycing, as the Bride rejoyceth in her Bridegroom: for thou, O Lord, knoweſt my many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and imperfections, and that I cannot do any thing well pleaſing unto thee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of this thy Holy Spirit, for that my heart is all evil, only evil, and continually evil; leave me therefore, O Lord, this thine holy and bleſſed Spirit the Sanctifier, and the Comforter that I may be ever led in the ways of all truth and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which may conduct me unto thy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place, which is all peace, reſt, holineſs, bleſſedneſs, and eternal life, and happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

               <p n="188">188. The preſence of God (which is Communion with him through his Holy Spirit) is the feaſt of fat and pleaſant things, yea the Feaſt of Feaſts unto that Soul, and every Soul that hath truly taſted of him.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Gods love is ſweeter than the honey or the honey comb, much more deſired, and to be deſired more by much, than all fine gold, and the moſt pretious Pearls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Gods love is better than Wine to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the heart, it is the fatneſs, marrow, and ſweetneſs of Heaven, that feeds, feaſts, and ſolaceth the Soul.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is nothing in Heaven above to be compared to Gods love.</p>

God ſheweth his great love unto us, how he loveth us, by ſhedding abroad his love ſo in our hearts, as we are made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to love him, for naturally we love him not; and therefore did he not give us love to love him, we would, nor could never love him.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Ah powerful love that makes (of us haters) to become true lovers, to love him in very truth, whom we hated truly.</p>
               <p>Yea thoſe that have the love of God thus in their hearts, love him ſo, as it may be truly ſaid of them, that they love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, for they love him above their goods, or good name, above their Children, above their Wives, yea much more, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their very lives. They can, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, when called thereto, give up all to him and for him, his love doth conſtrain, to love him again, the heart is ſo in love with him, finding him ſo lovely, that it cryes out continually for more love, that it

               <p n="13">13. Such is the love of God unto us his Children, that he ſwallows us up and houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in himſelf, that we may be all his, and he all ours, that we may put him ſo on, as be made like him, and partake continually of him, which is our Crown and Glory, yea our Crown in Glory which will make us ſhine more beautiful and glorious than ten thouſand Sons.</p>

Cauſe me, O Lord God, to declare what thou wilt have me to declare; cauſe me to believe what thou wilt have me to believe, cauſe me to know what thou wilt have me to know, and inable me to do all that thou wilt have me to do, that I may be filled with thee, to live to thee and in thee to thine Eternal honour, praiſe and glory, ſo be it, O Lord, ſo be it, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

            <p>ALL happineſs is in Chriſt and in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of him, and there is no true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs out of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>All the whole world is much too little, and too low to be compared to Chriſt, and to the living in him.</p>
            <p>Though he ſhould want bread to eat, and Cloaths to put on, Chriſt I am ſure alone will ſatisfie, and truly pleaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent any man.</p>
            <p>A naked Chriſt, a poor Chriſt, that is a Chriſt that ſhall bring nakedneſs, and if as with <hi>Job,</hi> Poverty and uncomlineſs; he will be to a Soul that truly knows him, the faireſt of ten thouſand, without ſpot or wrinkle, the only fair and beautiful, the only deſirable, the whole and only deſires,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:151112:227"/> the riches, honour, treaſure, and pleaſure of all ſouls that truly know him.</p>
            <p>A ſoul that truly knows Chriſt, cannot live as he would, without a farther know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, living in him, to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowſhip with him, which is of more value to him, and he prizeth it more than ten thouſand worlds and lives, Chriſt being above all things, and more than all things much by much.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtians laſt hour is his beſt hour, the hour of his Death is the beſt hour of all his life; yea that hour is the true beginning of life, for Death, ſin, and Hell are ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into Victory, and the Devil totally and finally overcome.</p>
            <p>Death is advantagious unto a Chriſtian divers wayes; when he dyes then he begins to live in the Lord, who is the Lord of life and glory, then he ſhall in a very great meaſure know, feel, and ſee the unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble love of God to him, but I conceive not altogether ſo as it is in God, that ſhall even ſurpaſs our knowledge there, for we ſhall be ſwallowed up into it, and be filled with it, it ſhall contain us, but we ſhall not be able to contain it, and there ſhall we have continual and perfect love; to love God perfectly and continually, even as he would have us to love him, which is the continual
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:151112:228"/> fulfilling the whole Law, and which will make us of all things moſt like himſelf, for God is love, and ſurely it is the moſt lovely grace of all graces, both on earth as well as in Heaven; and ſo, through grace I have found it; Ah let us never then pray againſt Death, which brings us theſe and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more Heavenly advantages, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be prepared to meet it with joy, and embrace it as our beſt friend, next to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Ah how ſweet is Death, even almoſt as Heaven, to that ſoul that is houſed in God, and hath his peace made ſure with him; Death to ſuch a ſoul is much better than any life.</p>
            <p>Ah how ſweet is Death to that ſoul that knows Heaven is prepared for him, and finds, and feels himſelf prepared for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſees his Saviour with his bleſſed arms ſpread abroad to welcome and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, and his glorious head bowed down to kiſs him, and he nigh him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into his Everlaſting Habitation of reſt, joy and peace.</p>
            <p>Death at the worſt is but a ſweet ſleep to the body, to him that dyes in the Lord, for he reſts from all his labours; but it is life to the ſoul, and it ſhall ever live in and with the Lord of life and Glory.</p>
            <pb n="427" facs="tcp:151112:228"/>
            <p>I am ſure to a good Chriſtian, that is, ſuch a one as is in ſome meaſure like Chriſt that lives, and walks, and doth (as far as he is able) as Chriſt did when he was here in the fleſh, the thoughts of death, and its being not far off, bring him the moſt joy next to the Glory of God, and his intereſt in him by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Ah how ſweet is death to that ſoul that knows himſelf to be long ſince dead to all ſin.</p>
            <p>Death is ſweet to all ſuch ſouls, becauſe he be-friends them ſo much as in a moment to houſe them in the bleſſed arms of their bleſſed Redeemer Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Death is ſweet to them that are in Chriſt, becauſe he carries them in a moment to live in his preſence for ever and for ever, and to enjoy him as he is to be enjoyed, and to be made like him, glorious as he is glorious, though not ſo glorious.</p>
            <p>Death is to all that are in Chriſt, as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>'s Chariot of fire, which purifies them, and expels all the remainder of Corruption that is within them, that is by death, all evil is done away, we are no more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſin by death, death is deſtroyed, and life appears.</p>
            <p>But Death to the wicked is the Devils Chariot ſent from Hell to bring them quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:151112:229"/> there, as <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Chariot it drives them furiouſly thither, from whence none is able to deliver.</p>
            <p>Death to the Godly is a Conſuming fire to all their ſins, they ſhall not ever more be ſeen or remembred, but it is a fire as from Gods Altar, to purifie their graces, and to make them ſhine more radiant than the Sun; after death they ſhall in a moment be made perfectly pure, and purely perfect, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo abide.</p>
            <p>But Death to the Wicked is that fire of Hell that ſhall conſume all the good that ever they did, ſo as it ſhall not, nor cannot be ſeen nor remembred; but it will make all the evil that ever they committed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thought, word or deed, to be ever before the eyes of God, and all the bleſſed in Heaven, and before the Devils, and all the damned, and their own, as if writ with a beam of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Death to thoſe that are in Chriſt, brings them to hear that ſweet and ever bleſſed voice of Chriſt himſelf; come ye bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom prepared for you from all Eternity, and well done good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But it may be thou wilt not believe it, till thou haſt felt it, if thou art ſuch a fool, and ſuch an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to thy own ſoul, to thine own peril be it.

But know that if thou neglecteſt it, and wilt put it off till the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; know that there is no to morrow in all the Scripture; 'tis to day if thou wilt

The Lord ſpeak ſo effectually to thy dry, obdurate, rocky heart, that it may ſo hear as thy ſoul may live, and that theſe words may prove a ſavour of death to all thy ſins, and of life unto thy poor Soul.</p>
            <p>Death to all that are in Chriſt is a day of Harveſt, of reaping, gathering and gain; it will be to him a day of Eſpouſals, ſhe ſhall be married unto the faireſt Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom that ever was; <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s Beauty will be blackneſs and uncomelineſs to his, to the richeſt that ever was; <hi>Solomon</hi>'s riches will be but as <hi>Job</hi>'s poverty compared to his: And to the moſt higheſt in honour that ever was, being King of kings and Lord of lords; to him all Kings ſhall fall, and caſt their Crowns at his feet.</p>
            <p>Death to a true believer is the beſt of all things, becauſe it brings him to poſſeſs all things, yea to poſſeſs Chriſt himſelf, who is the giver of all things, and much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all things, much by much.</p>
            <p>A Soul in Chriſt is always ready to meet and imbrace death at midnight or mid-day, at the Cock-crowing or any other time, he hath his life as it were in his hand, always
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:151112:230"/> ready and willing to lay it down, or give it up to him that gave it him, and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; he accounts nothing his own but all Chriſts, and that he hath all things both in Heaven and Earth, having him.</p>
            <p>When Death is ready to carry us into the arms of Chriſt, the Ark of our peace and reſt, then the Devil many times rageth moſt againſt us. But Chriſt our Captain and deliverer, who will ſave us to the utmoſt, (as the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi>) roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt him, and forceth him to a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and yielding retreat. But to Saints our Chriſt appears as a Lamb, meek and pacified, yea as the Lamb of God that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away all our ſins, that he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us ſpotleſs and unblameable unto his Father, that we may as Children and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with himſelf, receive a Crown incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and the inheritance prepared for us from all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Death to us, that are dead to ſin, and alive to Chriſt, hath no ſting, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot in the leaſt do us any harm, wherefore we cheriſh him, and as a dear friend are glad to hear of him, and ſo think often on him, and when he comes, we bid him moſt heartily welcome, entertain him kindly, and lodge him in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms.</p>
            <pb n="432" facs="tcp:151112:231"/>
            <p>But to thoſe that know not Chriſt, his Maſter, and have no intereſt in him, nor his mark on their foreheads, he comes in flames of fire, and as a moſt cruel Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, to execute on them the direful and eternal doom of God, and ſo carries them poſt and headlong to Hell, delivering them into the hands and power of their grand E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy the Devil, to be tormented in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burning, world without end, or for ever and for ever.</p>
            <p>Death, Ah how comely art thou in the ſight of all Gods Children? that art ſent by him, to bring them to ſee him, their King, Lord and Maſter, that have ſo long deſired to ſee this day, and thy delightſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, thou art moſt welcome and dear as the moſt deareſt Brother; come in thou Meſſenger of the moſt Higheſt. I know what thou haſt to ſay unto me, thou bringeſt me the gladdeſt tidings that ever I heard, I am ready to go with thee when thou wilt, I ſhall be now ſoon brought to my long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired home, to my everlaſting habitation of repoſe and reſt. Now my Soul thou ſhalt be no longer perplext nor troubled, all ſighing for ſin, and fear of ſinning ſhall flie away; now is that bleſſed day come where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou ſhalt at once have all thy Prayers anſwered, all thy deſires, petitions and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:151112:231"/> ſuits granted, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand more than ever thou didſt ask or think; now thou ſhalt ſin, grieve nor offend thy God no more, but evermore ſerve, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, obey and pleaſe him. Now thou ſhalt ſee him who created thee, God the Father; him who redeemed thee, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Son, and him who ſo often comforted thee, and hath ſanctified thee; the Holy Ghoſt, the bleſſed Spirit, three in one, and one in three, which is a great myſtery, but moſt true; Ah happy they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom it hath been manifeſtly manifeſted, ſuch have Eternal life, and therefore fear not death.</p>
            <p>But to the wicked that fee and know themſelves out of Chriſt, death is to all ſuch the King of Terrors; they dread and fear him more than all the Kings, Tyrants, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Tormentors in the World, nay than the Devil himſelf; for 'tis by death that they are ſent or brought to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for ever one with another; 'tis death carries them to that infernal habitation, that throws them headlong into that Lake of fire and brimſtone, into that bottomleſs pit of black thick darkneſs which may be felt, that binds them in fetters ſo ſtrong as none is able to deliver them, and then flies ſwifter than the wind from them, reſolving
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:151112:232"/> (which they know) never to return to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them, and this later woe, for ever to abide ſo, is the greateſt of all; this ſinks their hearts, and hopes into an everlaſting deſpair, which moſt of all makes death dreadful to them, and they would much rather lye under the greateſt rocks or mountains, or be caſt with a milſtone about their necks, into the bottom of the Sea: But it cannot be, death will execute his part of the doom pronounced againſt them, by him that judgeth wiſely, righteouſly and juſtly, and that ſpake as never man ſpake.</p>

Ah how is it to be pittied, and dolefully lamented, that ſo many poor ſouls ſhould believe lyes, and the Father of lyes (the Devil,) before thy word and thy ſelf, who art the God of all truth and love; how great, Ah how great was thy love, O God, to ſave poor loſt ſinners, in ſparing and giving thy own only dear and beloved Son, to the moſt ſhameful and moſt painful death of the Croſs, to redeem them from ſin, death,

               <p>Ah Lord, thou knoweſt how often ſuch like conſiderations have ſadened my ſoul; that thou who art the God of truth, ſhould'ſt be thought by ſo many (as it were) a lyer; for thy Word is not believed by them, but made as a thing of nought, trampled under foot, and caſt behind the back; and Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Whoremongers, and ſuch vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons words be received, entertain'd, taken up, welcom'd and preferr'd before thee, O God, before thee, and thy Word, and all thy moſt gracious offers of grace. Now if ſuch by thy good and gracious Providene, come to read theſe words, or of that which thou haſt made me to write, I humbly pray thee in Jeſus Chriſt thy Son, to pity him and pardon him. Ah fetch home, O God, all wandering Prodigals that are in far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries (that is) far from thee, ſeeding on Hogs and Harlots, which is, on their own fleſhly Carnal Luſts, and vile affections. Ah Father, I know thee to be full of love and compaſſion; Ah be thou pleaſed to do for all ſuch as thou haſt done for me, for ſuch was my moſt miſerable and woful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; But I praiſe thy glorious Name, thou haſt waſht, and cleanſed, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my ſoul.

Ah that the Devil had fewer Servants, and thou, O God, who art all goodneſs had'ſt more, that he were caſt off by all, and thy grace and favour accepted of; that he were diſowned; and thou, O God, for ever owned, to be only worthy to be believed in, feared, loved, prized, magnified and praiſed; let theſe, and a thouſand-fold more of thankſgiving, honour, and glory be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto thy moſt ſacred, and moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name, who art God of gods, and Lord of lords, the very and only true God, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever and for ever.</p>
               <p>Thus, even thus, O Lord, I have taken on me through the guidance of thy good ſpirit, to chatter a little as a Crane or a Swallow, and to ſpeak unto thee, and of thee with a ſtammering tongue; thou knoweſt how far ſhort and ſcant it is, to
